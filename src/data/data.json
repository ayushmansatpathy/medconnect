  "About": {
    "paragraph1": "MedConnect UMass seeks to connect UMass students interested in Pre-Health careers to gain more hands-on experience within the medical field in order to have a better understanding of what their future could entail. We plan on hosting an ongoing speaker series from hospital employees on topics ranging from their various fields of medicine and their daily routine to health disparities in the community. The club will connect students to local hospitals and clinics to gain knowledge within different specializations to find their interests and delve deeper.",
    "paragraph2": "Serving as the intermediary between the limited number of hospitals/clinics in the area and UMass Amherst, the club simplifies the volunteer application process and offers students an easier route to patient care and volunteer hours. MedConnect UMass prepares our members for a career in the healthcare field through invaluable experiences while shaping members to be a more competitive applicant for post-grad health education.",

In the fall of my sophomore year, I decided that I wanted to pursue a career in the medical field, so up until recently I have not been too involved in the field, besides clubs from UMass and my old school. However, this summer I did have an internship with an optometrist where I could gain clinical, hands-on experience while also conducting research and writing up a research presentation on a patient with an extraordinary case. I have also been shadowing with a general dentist weekly throughout the summer and plan to continue to shadow different parts of the field. "
